From [Hacking with Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/books/ios-swiftui/drawing-wrap-up):

> 1.  Create an Arrow shape â€“ having it point straight up is fine. This could be a rectangle/triangle-style arrow, or perhaps three lines, or maybe something else depending on what kind of arrow you want to draw.
> 2.  Make the line thickness of your Arrow shape animatable.
> 3.  Create a ColorCyclingRectangle shape that is the rectangular cousin of ColorCyclingCircle, allowing us to control the position of the gradient using one or more properties.
